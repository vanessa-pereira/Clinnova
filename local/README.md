# Models creation and management

In this section will be saved the archetypes that are stated on https://github.com/vanessa-pereira/Clinnova/blob/main/openEHR/instruments_list.md and will be connected to an ADL designer instance, constant commits from different accounts are expected to happen. 

Once is reaches a stable stage, will be moved to https://github.com/vanessa-pereira/Clinnova/tree/main/openEHR/archetypes and shared with the international CKM.

This folder "local" has been automatically created by openEHR archetype designer tool and will work for development only.
