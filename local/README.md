# Models creation and management

In this section will be saved the archetypes that are stated on https://github.com/vanessa-pereira/Clinnova/blob/main/openEHR/instruments_list.md and will be connected to an ADL designer instance, constant commits from different accounts are expected to happen. 

Once it reaches a stable stage, will be moved to https://github.com/vanessa-pereira/Clinnova/tree/main/openEHR/archetypes and shared with the international CKM.

This folder "local" has been automatically created by openEHR archetype designer tool and will work for development only, but depending on updates of manipulation of github folders within the tool, it will be moved to the openEHR folder, once this is possible.
