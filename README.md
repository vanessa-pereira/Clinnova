# Clinnova

Initial clinical models and implementation guides for clinnova project (http://clinnova.lu) will be posted here and later merged to official github.

Will use redcap, cdash, openEHR and FHIR for data record, structuring and exchange, and the models will be saved here, along with the terminologies codesystems and valuesets used for the different cohorts.

For more information and colaboration, feel free to contact me at vanessa.pereira@lih.lu
