This archetype is to be used to record information about both current and previous substance use behaviour.

The specific scope of this archetype includes all types of addictive substances, including, but not limited to: recreational drugs; solvents; and caffeine. The only exceptions are alcohol consumption, tobacco smoking and smokeless tobacco use because these substances have been modelled in other, specific archetypes.

The 'Episode' cluster allows for recording of specific details, routes and forms during a specified period of time. If the pattern, route or form changes significantly, record the details in a new instance of the Episode' CLUSTER.
Triggers for closing one episode and commencing a new one will largely reflect local data collection preferences, including if the individual:
- quits for a significant period of time; or
- significantly changes their amount, route or form of their substance use.

If multiple forms of the substance are consumed, the details will be recorded in the 'Per form' CLUSTER within this archetype.

If multiple routes are used, the details will be recorded in the 'Per route' CLUSTER within this archetype. 

If other substances are used, the details will be recorded in another instance of this archetype.

Use to incorporate the narrative descriptions of substance use habits within existing or legacy clinical systems into an archetyped format, using the 'Overall description' data element.">
			misuse = <"Not to be used to record information about tobacco use - use EVALUATION.tobacco_smoking_summary or EVALUATION.smokeless_tobacco_summary for this purpose.

Not to be used to record information about alcohol use - use EVALUATION.alcohol_use_summary for this purpose.

Not to be used to record event-or period-based information about substance use, such as actual daily use or the average use over a specified period of time - use the OBSERVATION.substance_use archetype.">
