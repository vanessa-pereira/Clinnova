For each single value there's a question associated.
- Joint problems; have you had painful, red or swollen joints? The most common joints affected are the knees, ankles or toes.
- Eye problems; have you had sore, red and swollen eyes? Other symptoms include blurry vision, sensitivity to light, floaters or increased tear production? 
- Mouth problems; The most common problems are round or oval mouth ulcers which usually appear as round yellowish elevated spots surrounded by a red halo.
-  Skin problems: Do you have any deep, purple ulcers, often painful, which usually develop suddenly?
-  Skin problems: Do you have any tender, hot and red bumps which most often affect the skin on the shins, arms and legs?
- Perianal problems. Do you have any tears or breakdown (crack/ cleft) in the skin of the anus or tender lumps (abscesses) surrounding it?">
