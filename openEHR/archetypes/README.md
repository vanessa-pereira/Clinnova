# Archetypes section

The openEHR archetypes build for the Clinnova project will stay in this repository until severely tested in real world cases. 
Once they are ready to go, compliant with openEHR style guides, they will be submitted to the international openEHR CKM.

In this section will be saved the archetypes that are stated on https://github.com/vanessa-pereira/Clinnova/blob/main/openEHR/instruments_list.md.
This section will be connected to an ADL designer instance, constant commits from different accounts are expected to happen. 

Once the archetypes reach a stable stage, a list will be available on this README.
