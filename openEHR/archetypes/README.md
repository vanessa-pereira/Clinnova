# Archetypes section

The openEHR archetypes build for the Clinnova project will stay in this section until severely tested in real world cases. Once they are ready to go, compliant with openEHR style guides, they will be submitted to the international openEHR CKM but we will still have a copy of them there, just in case.

Once the archetypes reach a stable stage, a list will be available on this README.
