# Models creation and management

In this section will be saved the archetypes that are stated on https://github.com/vanessa-pereira/Clinnova/blob/main/openEHR/instruments_list.md and will be connected to an ADL designer instance, constant commits from different accounts are expected to happen. 

Once it reaches a stable stage, will be shared with the international CKM.

All archetypes that are for PROM will be translated in english (en), german (de) and french (fr).
