			purpose = <"The Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) is used in clinical trials to assess disease activity in Crohn's disease. Crohn disease is a chronic transmural inflammatory bowel disease that usually affects the distal ileum and colon but may occur in any part of the gastrointestinal tract. Symptoms include diarrhea and abdominal pain. Abscesses, internal and external fistulas, and bowel obstruction may arise. Extraintestinal symptoms, particularly arthritis, may occur.">

			misuse = <"CDAI has some limitations, which include:
- interobserver variability
- ratings of 'general well being' and 'intensity of abdominal pain' are subjective
- stool frequency is based on a diary filled in by the patient for 7 days before evaluation which doesn't generally get done in routine clinical practice
- it is not accurate in patients with fistulizing and stenosing disease
- it is not useful in patients with previous extensive ileo-colonic resections or stoma
